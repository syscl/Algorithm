Let the $d_1, \cdots, d_k$ be the denominations, $n$ be the amount of money, $c_p$ be the minimum number of coins of current denomination system needed to make change for $p$. Let
\begin{flalign}
	&c_0 = 0\\
	c_p = &\min_{1\leq i \leq k} (1 + c_{p - d_i}) \label{recurrence_eq}
\end{flalign}
then $c_p$ is optimal solution to $p$.\\\\
Before we completes the proof, We have to prove the following lemmas.\\\\
\textbf{Lemma 1} Let $X=\{x_1, \cdots, x_k\}$ be an optimal solution where $x_i$ is the number of $d_i$ being used. If $P\subseteq X$ and $\alpha=\sum\limits_{x_i\in P} d_i x_i$, then $P$ is an optimal solution to $\alpha$.
	\begin{proof}
		If $P$ is not an optimal solution to $P$, there there must exist a set $Q\subseteq X$ such that $\alpha = \sum\limits_{x_i\in Q} d_i x_i$ and $\sum\limits_{x\in Q} x < \sum\limits_{x\in P} x$. If that is the case,
		\begin{flalign}
			\sum\limits_{x \in Q\cup (X-P)} x < \sum\limits_{x\in X} x \label{key}
		\end{flalign} 
		and this is contradict to $X$ is an optimal solution since $Q\cup (X-P)$ is a valid solution.
	\end{proof}
	\textbf{Corollary} $X-P$ is optimal solution to  $n-\alpha$.\\\\
	We now go to prove the recurrence relation $c_p$ is optimal solution. 
	\begin{proof}
		For the base case where $c_0=0$ is trivially correct. By \textbf{Lemma 1}, the optimal solution to the coin changing problem is composed of optimal solutions to smaller subproblems, which completes the proof.
	\end{proof}
\end{document}
